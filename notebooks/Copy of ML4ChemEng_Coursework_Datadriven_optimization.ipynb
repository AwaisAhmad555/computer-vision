In this coursework, you will design your own DFO solver. You have complete freedom in what type of DFO algorithm you want to implement - direct, model-based, evolutionary search, ... Since the takeaway is on optimising chemical engineering systems, we operate under the following assumptions:\n","\n","- Evaluations are expensive, meaning that the runtime of the algorithms is limited by a fixed evaluation budget rather than a time budget constraint. However, we will not consider algorithms that take longer than 5 minutes for a budget of 1,000 evaluations. Therefore, it might be a good idea to have your algorithm exit, and return the best value found so far if the timing is nearing the 5 minute mark (see for [example](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/889900/accurate-timing-of-functions-in-python))\n","\n","- We are allowing for budgets ranging between 50 and 1,000 evaluations depending on dimensionalities ranging between 1 and 100\n","\n","- Input bounds for all dimensions are known\n","\n","\n","You are given training functions, but you are encouraged to look for your own; This [website](https://www.sfu.ca/~ssurjano/optimization.html) can be useful. Your implementation will be graded based on the best objective evaluation obtained. You will get a minimum of 60% if your implementation beats all benchmarks (Nelder-Mead, Powell, COBYLA), or if you get within $10^{-4}$ of their objective within the allocated budget, and the rest of your grade will be curved by state-of-the-art solvers. A (very bad) optimizer function is given for illustration. \n","\n","The same marking procedure will then be applied to the testing functions  that you cannot see. This is to make sure that the performance of your optimizer is not 'overfitted' on the training functions. You can prepare for this part by making sure your algorithm still performs well on some of the test functions in the above link. I will make sure that the type of problems remains similar when going from the training to test functions, i.e., I will not test the functions on highly nonconvex / multimodal functions if there are none given as training functions. In the test functions you will get 40% of the overall marks for beating the benchmarks.\n","\n","**IMPORTANT**:\n","\n","- Good coding practice: Make sure your function takes the same inputs and outputs as the illustrative optimizer, and make sure that your implementation is flexible enough to handle different dimensionalities. This is **very important**, as otherwise we have no way to test your algorithms, and you will not get marks for those problems (this is easily mitigated by making sure your algorithms run in the training set and follow same inputs and outputs as the sample function).\n","\n","- Stochasticity: You are highly encouraged to set random seeds if your implementation involves stochasticity. This is to make sure that your implementation works as expected when marking.\n","\n","- Packages: please restrict to use numpy, scipy, and GPy. You are allowed to use scipy.optimize to train any surrogates if you wish, but you are not allowed to optimize f() directly, neither to use GPyOpt directly on the functions.\n","\n","- Runtime: For our inexpensive test functions, your algorithm should finish running in **5** minutes, otherwise it will not be graded. This becomes especially relevant if you decide to pursue supplementary workbook B.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"1txoO0ssIVSk"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Some packages"],"metadata":{"id":"d13ajElfTkNL"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import random\n","import time\n","import numpy as np\n","\n","from functools import partial\n","from typing import List, Tuple, Dict\n","from scipy.optimize import minimize, differential_evolution, show_options\n"],"metadata":{"id":"Z-_CgN8iIVn3","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1675072936211,"user_tz":-300,"elapsed":362,"user":{"displayName":"Awais Ahmad","userId":"17510577265023244828"}}},"execution_count":1,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Some test functions"],"metadata":{"id":"DPX_0DaUTnKK"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["def f_d2(x: List[float]) -> float:\n","  '''\n","  f is the \"black-box\" function that needs to be optimized\n","  Input:\n","    x: list of size N_x/ array of size (N_x,)\n","  Output:\n","    float: function evaluation associated with x\n","  '''\n","  x = np.array(x)\n","  return (1-x[0])**2 + 100*(x[1]-x[0]**2)**2\n","\n","def f_d3(x: List[float]) -> float:\n","  '''\n","  f is the \"black-box\" function that needs to be optimized\n","  Input:\n","    x: list of size N_x/ array of size (N_x,)\n","  Output:\n","    float: function evaluation associated with x\n","  '''\n","  x = np.array(x)\n","  return (1-x[0])**2 + 100*(x[1]-x[0]**2)**2 + x[2]**2"],"metadata":{"id":"naGXPGqQ9E_y","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1675073314068,"user_tz":-300,"elapsed":389,"user":{"displayName":"Awais Ahmad","userId":"17510577265023244828"}}},"execution_count":4,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["A dummy optimizer function.

As a rule of thumb, DFO solvers are useful up to around 100 dimensions. This is especially problematic for model-based derivative-free optimization solvers where typically at least $\\mathcal{O}(n_d)$ are needed to construct meaningful surrogates for simple linear surrogates.\n","\n","However, many problems present particular mathematical structures that can be exploited to address the curse of dimensionality. These problems present a true / intrinsic / effective dimensionality that is less than the 'natural' dimensionality $n_e \\leq n_d$. These problems arise in hyperparameter estimation for example, where changes in only a few dimensions explains much of the variability in the objective. These functions are also said to have 'low effective dimensionality', or 'active subspaces'. An example in chemical engineering might be the following: Imagine you want to use derivative-free optimization to (among other variables) find the optimal set of flow of pure component A ($F_A$) and B ($F_B$) into a reactor. In this case, although you theoretically have complete freedom over both flows, in practice, you could optimize the ratio of A to B instead.\n","\n","The following [paper](https://academic.oup.com/imaiai/article/11/1/167/6278168) has a nice introduction and motivating case. There is no need to read through the theoretical derivations.\n","\n","An alternative to the iterative random embeddings presented in the previous approach would be to use partial least squares or other dimensionality reduction technique to find the lower-order embeddings.\n","\n","Another approach would be to use statistical methods (either after an initial space-filling design, or iteratively) to decide which dimensions are most important and worth 'fine-tuning'. This framework of considering a subset (or linear combinations) of  the orginal dimensions could also be employed to direct DFO methods (for example coordinate search).
